              <br></br>
              <p>Yamifood Catering was created in 2006 out of a passion for amazing food and service.
                 The then one-man operation saw rapid growth after booking its very first eventâ€”catering 
                 the anniversary party for the Austin Film Society and its 1,000 guests.
              
              <br></br><br></br>
              
              Through word of mouth, a lot of hard work and a commitment to producing
              one-of-a-kind events, Yamifood has become one of the most beloved catering 
              companies in Austin..</p>
